# Project Name: Library Training System

## Objective

The **Library Training System** project is designed to manage a library's operations and provide users with features such as book management, user roles (admin and user), and a secure login/registration system. The project integrates a back-end system built using **Spring Boot 3.X.X** and a front-end application built using technologies such as **React**, **Vaadin**, or **Flutter**. The system also includes a secure authentication mechanism using **JWT** for role-based access control, with roles for regular users and administrators.

## Features
- User authentication (JWT-based login and registration).
- Role-based access control (Admin and User roles).
- Book and Library management.
- RESTful API with **Spring Boot** backend.
- Frontend options (React, Vaadin, or Flutter).
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Docker.
- Database support using **PostgreSQL**.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several main sections:
1. **Conception**:
   - Diagrams (Class, Use Case, and Sequence Diagrams) designed using **Mermaid.js**.
   - Prototyping with **Figma** for UI design.
2. **Design**:
   - Frontend design with tools like **Figma** for UI/UX.
3. **Code**:
   - Backend: Spring Boot 3.X.X.
   - Frontend: React, Vaadin, or Flutter.
4. **Deployment**:
   - CI/CD setup using Docker, Docker Compose & Jenkins for easy deployment and scalability.
5. **Reports**:
   - Documentation and final project reports in PDF format.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.X.X, JWT, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Vaadin, Flutter (choose one as per the project need)
- **CI/CD**: Docker, Docker Compose, Jenkins
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Prototyping**: Figma
- **Diagrams**: Mermaid.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17**
- **Node.js (for React)**
- **Docker**
- **PostgreSQL**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-training-system.git
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
    Navigate to the backend folder and run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
    Navigate to the frontend folder (React/Vaadin/Flutter) and start the application:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

4. **Database Setup**:
    Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the required credentials are set in the application properties.

5. **Docker Setup**:
    Run the application with Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
