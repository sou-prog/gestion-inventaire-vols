# Conception Phase

## Overview

The **Conception** phase is crucial for the initial planning and architecture of the project. In this phase, we focus on analyzing the requirements and creating diagrams to represent the system's structure and behavior.

## Diagrams

Below are links to the various diagrams created during the conception phase:

### 1. [Class Diagram](diagrams/classdiagram.md)
