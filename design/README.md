# Design Phase

## Overview

The **Design** phase focuses on transforming the conceptual diagrams into a concrete visual prototype of the system. During this phase, we use **Figma** to create a high-fidelity design prototype that provides a clear representation of how the final product will look and function.

This phase involves two key elements:
1. **UI/UX Design**: Creating the visual layout of the user interface, ensuring an intuitive and accessible experience for users.
2. **Interaction Design**: Defining the behavior of different elements in the interface, such as buttons, forms, and navigation.

## Figma Prototype

We have used **Figma** to create the initial prototype for the project. This prototype serves as a blueprint for the development phase, detailing how the user interface should be structured and how users will interact with the system.

You can download or view the Figma design file below:

Alternatively, you can view the design directly on Figma (if hosted online) by following this link: [Figma Online Prototype](#).

> **Note:** Ensure you have a Figma account to open and modify the design.

## Design Documentation

The design process included several steps:
1. **Wireframes**: Initial low-fidelity wireframes were created to map out the basic layout of the application.
2. **User Flow**: Diagrams were made to visualize how users will navigate through the application.
3. **High-fidelity Prototype**: A fully detailed, high-resolution prototype with colors, typography, and imagery that closely mirrors the final product.

### Screens Included in the Prototype:
- **Home Screen**: The landing page of the application.
- **User Login/Signup**: User authentication screens.
- **Dashboard**: Main dashboard where users can interact with core functionalities.
- **Settings**: Screens for user and system settings.
- **Error Pages**: Standard error pages (404, 500, etc.).

## Next Steps

Once the design is finalized and approved, we will proceed with the **development phase**, where the prototype will be implemented into code, divided into the frontend and backend, using technologies such as React, Spring Boot, and others.
